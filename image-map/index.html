    <h1>Essay on why I decided to pick the areas I did</h1>
    <p>The image above is a from a popular fighting game called <i>BlazBlue Cross Tag</i>. This game under the sub-genre of fighting game called tag fighters. 
    In these types of games, a player can chose multiple characters to create a team. In game, the player can choose to switch between characters to battle and compete 
    against another player with there team. This style of gameplay allows not only more creativity, but more possiblilities, strategedies, and depth to a game. Due to 
    being a tag game, the studio that made these games decided to take many characters from other games to create the roster. 
    </p>
    <p> Since this game includes many characters from outside the <i>BlazBlue</i> franchise, I decided that each area should go to there respected character page. Therefore I
    chose the characters in the cover to be clickable. Just like how this game decided to bring other characters into the game to allow fans to get introduced to other games, 
    I decided to do the same. Each area links to the characters wiki page to allow visitor of the site to learn about the other characters and their respetive game or anime. 
    This is hopes to either peak the interest of the vistor to either the main game or the characters of each game.
    </p>
    <p>The areas of the characters that would be clickable were also something I needed to consider. For example, I need to choose between making the characters face and/or body 
    the clickable area. I came to notice that my natural tendancy were to click on a characters torso rather than the face. Due to this, I decided to make sure that the area 
    that was clickable was centered around the torso. However when clicking a character that was very obstructed due to another character (ie. the girl in white), my natural tendancy
    was to click the characters face. So for each character, I tried best as possible to have the image map area cover the torso and face. </p>
